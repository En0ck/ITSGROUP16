inheritance is the pillar of object oriented programming where by block of code used in the programme without repeating writting of that code.reusability of the code.
in the c programming function we can inhert the code by using a certain function without writting again.Example from the code above inheritance it occurs when codes written in main function to be inherited or used as reference on caling a function


encaplsuation is the pillar of object oriented programming where by codes are wrapped to get rid from unneccesary interaction between two or more block of code.

abstraction is the pillar of object oriented programming where by the unnecesary details are hidden to the user.

polymophisim is the pillar of object oriented programming where by one object may have many behaviours in the programming.

Explanation of the pillars of object oriented programming to the C programming language is difficult because a C programming language is procedural language hance at least inheritance is allowed in the C function.
